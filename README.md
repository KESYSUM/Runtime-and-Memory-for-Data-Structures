# Runtime-and-Memory-for-Data-Structures

the projects in this course focused on building and analyzing data structures. the first was about runtime and memory use of vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees, and the second was writing code to sort and print cs courses in alphanumeric order.

i approached the problems by breaking them down and looking at which data structure made the most sense for the task. understanding data structures is important because it directly affects performance, efficiency, and how well a program scales.

a few roadblocks came up—mostly around getting the sorting and traversal methods right—but i worked through them by testing different approaches and carefully debugging step by step.

these projects helped me think more critically about software design. i see now that picking the right structure isn’t just a school exercise, it’s what makes code faster, cleaner, and more useful in real situations.

my coding style has also improved—I write with readability and adaptability in mind now, so the program isn’t just working today but is easier to update or reuse later.
